# React + Axios + Json Server Books App

Application that simulates a virtual library where you can read synopsis of books interactively.
This app has three ways to be interacted with: as a guest (with limited functionality), as a user (you can add and delete books from favourites) and as admin (works the same as a normal user but you can also add and delete books from the database)

# Key Aspects

User value implementation such as: pagination, easy to navigate(web changes to adapt to the user being logged or not),
interactive books, encrypted passwords
