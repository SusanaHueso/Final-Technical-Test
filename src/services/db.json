        "Synopsis": "The first part of J Rz R Tolkiens epic masterpiece The Lord of the Rings, this is the story of young hobbit Frodo Baggins, who finds himself faced with an immense and terrible duty. Sauron has gathered to him all the Rings of Power, and intendes to use them to rule Middle-earth. All he lacks is the One Ring - the ring that rules them all, which through a series of coincidences, has fallen into unlikely hands - those of elderly hobbit Bilbo Baggins, of the Shire. When Bilbo entrusts the Ring to the care of the young nephew, Frodo must leave his home and  a dangerous journey to the Cracks of Doom to destroy the Ring and prevent Sauron realising his terrible plans.

      "Author": "L. M. Montgomery",
      "Genre": "Novel",
      "Year": "1908",
      "Synopsis": "This heartwarming story has beckoned generations of readers into the special world of Green Gables, an old-fashioned farm outside a town called Avonlea. Anne Shirley, an eleven-year-old orphan, has arrived in this verdant corner of Prince Edward Island only to discover that the Cuthberts—elderly Matthew and his stern sister, Marilla—want to adopt a boy, not a feisty redheaded girl. But before they can send her back, Anne—who simply must have more scope for her imagination and a real home—wins them over completely. A much-loved classic that explores all the vulnerability, expectations, and dreams of a child growing up, Anne of Green Gables is also a wonderful portrait of a time, a place, a family… and, most of all, love."

      "Title": "Dracula",
      "Author": "Bram Stoker",
      "Genre": "Gothic Fiction",
      "Year": "1897",
      "Synopsis": "When Jonathan Harker visits Transylvania to help Count Dracula with the purchase of a London house, he makes a series of horrific discoveries about his client. Soon afterwards, various bizarre incidents unfold in England: an apparently unmanned ship is wrecked off the coast of Whitby; a young woman discovers strange puncture marks on her neck; and the inmate of a lunatic asylum raves about the Master and his imminent arrival. In Dracula, Bram Stoker created one of the great masterpieces of the horror genre, brilliantly evoking a nightmare world of vampires and vampire hunters and also illuminating the dark corners of Victorian sexuality and desire. This Norton Critical Edition includes a rich selection of background and source materials in three areas: Contexts includes probable inspirations for Dracula in the earlier works of James Malcolm Rymer and Emily Gerard. Also included are a discussion of Stokers working notes for the novel and Draculas Guest, the original opening chapter to Dracula. Reviews and Reactions reprints five early reviews of the novel. Dramatic and Film Variation focuses on theater and film adaptations of Dracula, two indications of the novels unwavering appeal. David J. Skal, Gregory A. Waller, and Nina Auerbach offer their varied perspectives. Checklists of both dramatic and film adaptations are included."
